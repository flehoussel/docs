# Supported Hardware

Below is a list of supported hardware. If you’re just starting out and planning to buy something for this project, I recommend choosing boards that support 5GHz Wi-Fi, as support for the 2.4GHz standard in Google services is gradually phasing out.

I’m starting the list with boards featuring the AIC8800 chipset. They support 5GHz Wi-Fi and, in my opinion, handle Bluetooth and Wi-Fi coexistence really well (I personally use a Bluetooth OBD dongle for EV features and Wi-Fi at the same time). Of course, your choice will depend on your preferences, availability in your country, and price (sometimes shipping costs are higher than the board itself, which obviously defeats the purpose).

From our Discord community, it turns out the most popular board among users is the Pi Zero 2 W. I’ve used it for years in this project, but having a direct comparison with other boards, you can often get a MilkV or Radxa board for the same price, which are much better suited for our use case.

Please also keep in mind that the order of the list is just my subjective take on what works best for this project. I don’t want this to be misunderstood as some ultimate truth carved in stone. For example, the Pi Zero 2 W being close to the bottom doesn’t mean it’s a bad board. There are scenarios where it works great – in my car it ran fine for a long time without any stuttering, until I started relying more heavily on Bluetooth alongside Wi-Fi. There *are* configurations where a Raspberry Pi is perfectly good enough, and its low power consumption is definitely a plus.

A clear advantage of Raspberry Pi boards is their huge popularity, which also means great availability. However, the Broadcom radio chipset they all use leaves a lot to be desired, in my opinion.

The thing with the Pi Zero 2 W (and Broadcom’s radio chipset in general) is that when you try to connect to a Bluetooth device – especially one that’s out of range – the Wi-Fi link tends to suffer. You start losing pings, and the Android Auto connection can drop entirely. That’s the main reason why, for this specific use case, other boards tend to perform better.

## Notes on Specifications, Measurements, and Links

The specifications listed below are taken from various sources – mainly official vendor websites, but also my own experience and information gathered from Wikipedia. If you spot any mistake, feel free to let me know!

**Power measurements:** for some boards I managed to measure power consumption using an oscilloscope and a 1-ohm shunt resistor. Whenever I have such data available, I include the corresponding waveforms.

::: warning
**AliExpress links:** I’m simply sharing the links I personally used to buy SBCs. I’m not responsible for them, nor am I affiliated with any seller. You buy at your own risk.

::: info
The aa-proxy image is prepared to run on the RISC-V core, not on the ARM Cortex one (which is probably good news, since it means it draws less current).

Even though the board supports eMMC, at the moment only SD card booting is supported. eMMC support is planned for the future.

:::
::: info
New devices shipped from the factory no longer require opening the case or shorting the MASKROM and GND pins to enter MaskROM mode.  
Instead, you can use the button on the device:  
Hold the button → plug in the USB cable → keep holding the button for 2 seconds → the device enters MaskRom mode.  
Once the device enters MaskRom mode (which you can confirm by the different USB device identity), you can use the flashing script provided here to upload the new firmware:  
https://github.com/aa-proxy/buildroot/tree/main/tools/aaw

For older devices, or if the button method does not work, you can still open the case and manually short the MASKROM and GND pins during startup to force the device into MaskRom mode:

## AAWireless Firmware Flashing Instructions
AAW boards have no removable media, so they flash over USB. Put the board into maskrom mode first:

- AAW1 — hold the pinhole button, then plug in USB,
::: details
  For very old CS307's you have to hold the pinhole button > 10 seconds, let go, and it will reboot into maskrom  
  For the later ones, it's the same hold button and plug in process as CS317
:::
- AAW2 (newer batch) — hold the button, plug in USB, and keep holding for 2 seconds,
- AAW3 — hold the button, plug in USB, and keep holding for 2 seconds,

Then flash using this repo:  
https://github.com/aa-proxy/buildroot/tree/main/tools/aaw

`./tools/aaw/flash.sh aaw1-cs317 buildroot/output/aaw1-cs317/images/sdcard.img`

`./tools/aaw/flash.sh aaw2b buildroot/output/aaw2b/images`

`./tools/aaw/flash.sh aaw3 buildroot/output/aaw3/images`

`aaw1-cs317` takes the `sdcard.img` file, `aaw2b` and `aaw3` take the `images` directory.

::: details Possible OTG problems
I have a reports that sometimes OTG on the Pi5 is not working. In this case the logs (`dmesg`) are saying:
```
dwc2 1000480000.usb: dwc2_core_reset: HANG! Soft Reset timeout GRSTCTL_CSFTRST
dwc2 1000480000.usb: probe with driver dwc2 failed with error -16
```
And aa-proxy is not working (HU connection problems). To solve this problem you need to manually flash
official [RaspberryPi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/) image and perform
a manual firmware update.  
Here are required steps:

**Step 1: Prepare the System:**  
Open a terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T).  
Update the system with the following commands: `sudo apt update`, `sudo apt full-upgrade`.  
Reboot Raspberry Pi to apply all updates: `sudo reboot`.

**Step 2: Update the Firmware:**  
Open a terminal window if it's not already open.  
Access the configuration tool: `sudo raspi-config`.  
Navigate to: __Advanced Options__ > __Bootloader Version__.  
Select __Latest__ to update the firmware to the newest version available.  
Exit the configuration tool and reboot Raspberry Pi to apply the changes: `sudo reboot`.

After this in aa-proxy the OTG should work:
```
[    0.089468] dwc_otg: version 3.00a 10-AUG-2012 (platform bus)
[    0.089487] dwc_otg: FIQ enabled
